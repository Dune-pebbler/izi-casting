# Compact Settings Feature

## Overview

The izi-casting application now includes a compact settings view that displays the current logo and color settings in the collapsed sidebar state. This provides administrators with a quick overview of their display settings without needing to expand the sidebar.

## Features

### 1. Compact Settings View (Collapsed State)
- **Location**: Bottom of the collapsed sidebar
- **Content**: Shows current logo and color settings in a condensed format
- **Interactive**: Clickable header to open full settings modal

### 2. Logo Preview
- **Display**: Shows a 32x32 pixel preview of the current logo
- **Conditional**: Only displays when a logo is uploaded
- **Styling**: Bordered with rounded corners for clean appearance

### 3. Color Preview
- **Background Color**: Labeled "BG" with color swatch
- **Foreground Color**: Labeled "FG" with color swatch
- **Interactive**: Hover effects with tooltips showing hex values
- **Visual**: 20x20 pixel color swatches with borders

### 4. Full Settings Modal
- **Trigger**: Click on "Geavanceerde instellingen" header
- **Content**: Full Settings component in a modal overlay
- **Responsive**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: Click outside to close, escape key support

## How It Works

### Technical Implementation

1. **State Management**: 
   - `showFullSettings`: Controls modal visibility
   - `settings`: Stores current logo and color values
   - Real-time updates via Firebase listener

2. **Conditional Rendering**: 
   - Collapsed state: Shows compact view
   - Expanded state: Shows full Settings component
   - Modal: Overlay with full settings when needed

3. **Real-time Updates**: 
   - Listens to Firebase settings document changes
   - Automatically updates compact view when settings change
   - Maintains consistency between compact and full views

### User Workflow

1. **Collapsed Sidebar**: See logo and color previews at bottom
2. **Click Settings**: Click "Geavanceerde instellingen" to open modal
3. **Edit Settings**: Make changes in the full settings interface
4. **Real-time Updates**: See changes reflected immediately in compact view
5. **Close Modal**: Click outside or close button to return to compact view
